                <p class="para">For your safety and hygiene, according to internationally-accepted standards, the permitted clothing

                <h3>Why dress code?</h3>
                <p class="para">Our amusement park has several rides to have fun on. Almost all of them involve motion or moving
                    parts
                    that require a special dress code to ensure your health and safety. For instance, loose garments
                    like
                    sarees, salwar, dupatta, churidar, shawls or scarves could get entangled and lead to potential harm
                    to
                    yourselves and others. In order to ensure that the water quality for all rides is maintained, we
                    enforce
                    a strict dress code.</p>
