                <li>Take breaks - stop before you get too tired</li>
                <li>Do not force others to take a ride</li>
                <li>Don't run inside the park</li>
                <li>Most of the pools are shallow; don't dive in the pools</li>
                <li>Guests with medical conditions should avoid rides that might impact their health</li>
                <li>Parents are advised to pay special attention to their children: children should be accompanied by
                    adults at all times</li>
                <li>Follow height restrictions for the rides - they are for your safety</li>

                    temporarily due to mechanical failure, stay seated and wait for the ride to start up again, or for
                    an operator to assist you</li>
